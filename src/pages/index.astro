      I have about five years of experience in web development, working at a web production and development company on a contract basis.
    </TyText>
    <TyText size="md">
      While I enjoy contributing to projects as a full-stack developer, my greatest passion lies in front-end development, where I take on the responsibility of connecting users with APIs. I particularly enjoy collaborating with designers to create beautiful UI interfaces, as well as designing and developing reusable components and logic. In addition, I have experience in back-end development using Laravel and infrastructure building centered on AWS, leveraging my previous experience as a network engineer. These opportunities have allowed me to gain a wide range of expertise across different projects.

        I am highly curious and take initiative.

      <TyText size="md">
        I enjoy exploring and experiencing new, unfamiliar things, which drives me to continually study and engage in activities every day.

      <TyText size="md">
        I initially began my career in the music industry but transitioned to becoming a web developer, where I have built full-stack development experience, focusing mainly on the front-end.

        I am skilled at prioritizing tasks.
      </TyText>
      <TyText size="md">
        I place a strong emphasis on deciding what not to do, allowing me to focus on my strengths and dedicate time to them, ultimately enhancing my performance. I believe that choosing not to do certain tasks creates a foundation for focusing on the essential ones.

        I avoid using overly strong expressions in communication.
      </TyText>
      <TyText size="md">
        I believe text-based communication can often come across as cold or harsh. Therefore, I strive to keep my expressions simple yet soft. When necessary, I also provide context or background to my statements to minimize misunderstandings.
